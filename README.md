# Forrest Watch 
## A small overview 
An App, developed for forrest workers and landowners to mark trees that may be infested, dying or have fallen. 
A user can simply mark a Tree using their smartphones GPS, name the marked tree so it can be easily recognized and save 
the marked tree so that other workers can easily find the tree and cut it down. 
The app gives the users an overview of all the marked tres in a list-like view. Shortly tapping any of the cards 
in this view opens a full screen map and zooms to the GPS location of this tree. After a marked tree has been cut down, 
it can be deleted by pressing and holding the tree entry in the List view
